The original code may have relied on a native module that Expo Go cannot load effectively.  Consider using `expo prebuild` to enhance compatibility, although it may still not work flawlessly with all native modules.  Often it's better to avoid heavy use of complex custom native modules during the development and testing phase, instead relying on readily-available Expo modules or JavaScript-based alternatives.  For example, if a native module was used for camera access, consider using the `expo-camera` library. This reduces reliance on features Expo Go might struggle to support. If using native modules is unavoidable, carefully check for any incompatibility issues with the Expo Go environment.

Example modification (assuming the original code tried to directly load a native module):

// bug.js (original problematic code - example)
import { NativeModules } from 'react-native';
const { MyNativeModule } = NativeModules;
// ... use MyNativeModule ...

// bugSolution.js (revised code)
// Use an alternative, Expo-compatible solution or remove reliance on native modules until later stages of development
import * as Camera from 'expo-camera'; // Example replacing a hypothetical native camera module
// ... use Expo's camera module ...
