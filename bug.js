This error occurs when using the Expo Go app to test an app that uses a custom native module. The error message is not very informative, but it generally indicates that the native module cannot be found or loaded by the Expo Go client.  This can happen even if the module is correctly configured in your project and builds fine on a real device or emulator.  The symptom is usually a completely blank or unresponsive app in Expo Go.
